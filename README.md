# Identifying Biases in Wiki-based Corpora

This project contains code replicating some of the calculations in this paper:

> Knoche, M., PopoviÄ‡, R., Lemmerich, F., & Strohmaier, M. (2019, September). Identifying biases in politically biased wikis through word embeddings. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM conference on hypertext and social media (pp. 253-257).

The paper trains embeddings on several Wikis (RationalWiki, Conservapedia, Wikipedia) and then applies
the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) to measure bias along a set of axes.

Reference papers describing WEAT are cited in the Jupyter notebook.
